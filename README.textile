h1. Rubiks

A Rubiks cube library (rubiks/cube) and TUI (rubiks) written in Go.

h2. Why?

Because. Bored.

h2. Coordinates

Okay, this bit is weird because I was hacking it as I went. (0,0,0) is the right front top cubelet.

- X-axis := Right to left
- Y-axis := Front to back
- Z-axis := Top to bottom

h2. Display

@func (cube) String() string@ displays the cube in the form:

pre..     UUU
     UUU
     UUU
LLL  FFF  RRR  BBB
LLL  FFF  RRR  BBB
LLL  FFF  RRR  BBB
     DDD
     DDD
     DDD

p. Note that this is the net of the cube, and so the rear face is mirrored right-to-left, as it has been unfolded around from the back.
